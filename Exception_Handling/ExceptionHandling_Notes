#. Exception Handling  : ==>

exception handling is a mechanism in Java used to handle runtime errors (like dividing by zero, accessing invalid array index, file not found, etc.) so that the program does not crash suddenly.
Instead of stopping the program, Java allows you to catch the error and handle it gracefully.

Why : ==> 

1. To prevent program crash
2. To handle unexpected situations
3. To provide alternative solutions
4. To display user-friendly messages

Keywords : ==>
1. try : Block where you write code that may cause an exception.
2. catch : Block that handles the exception thrown by the try block. (mutiple catch blocks allows handling different exceptions.)
3. finally : Block that always executes after try and catch, used for cleanup code.
4. throw:  Used to manually throw an exception.
5. throws: Used in method declaration to indicate that method may throw an exception.


#. Type of errors : ==>

1. compile time error : ==> Errors detected by the compiler during code compilation (syntax errors, type mismatches, etc.)
2. logical error : ==> Errors in program logic that produce incorrect(results programmerfault, wrongcalculations,incorrectconditions, etc.)
2. runtime error : ==> Errors that occur during program execution (division by zero, null pointer exceptions, etc.)
