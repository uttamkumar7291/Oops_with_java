File handling : File handling is the process of creating, reading, writing, and deleting files using a program. Java provides classes in the java.io and java.nio packages to work with files.


==>Common File Classes in Java

Class                     	Description
File	                   Used  to create, delete or get information about a file
FileReader	               Reads data from a file (character by character)
FileWriter	               Writes data to a file
BufferedReader	           Reads text efficient ly line by line
BufferedWriter	           Writes text efficiently
FileInputStream	           Reads  binary data
FileOutputStream	       Writes  binary data

Note :- In Java, file handling is mostly done using the methods of File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and Stream

 ==>Streams in Java
A Stream is a sequence of data.
It is a continuous flow of data from one place to another (program ↔ file, file ↔ program)
Streams make input/output (I/O) operations possible in Java.

Types of Streams:
[1.] Byte Streams (Binary Streams): Handle data in bytes (8 bits) and are used for binary data like images, audio, etc.
==> Base Classes:
1. InputStream → reads bytes
2. OutputStream → writes bytes

==> Common Byte Stream Classes:
    Class	                       Purpose
FileInputStream	            Reads bytes from a file
FileOutputStream	        Writes bytes to a file
BufferedInputStream	        Fast binary reading
BufferedOutputStream	    Fast binary writing

[2.] Character Streams: Handle data in characters (16 bits) and are used for text data.
==> Base Classes: 
2. output stream: Used to write data from the program to a destination (file, network, etc.)
